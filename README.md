# ReScript Checkers
I'm going to attempt to re-build my [reasonreact-checkers](https://github.com/danbowles/reasonreact-checkers/) ([Play it here!](https://danbowles.github.io/reasonreact-checkers/)) repo with [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/) and [React](https://rescript-lang.org/docs/react/latest/introduction).  I'm also using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the packaging.

Things I'll also try to accomplish:
* Drag/Drop pieces!
* Cypress Tests
* Make code more unit-testable
* Animations? Sliding and getting "king'd"

Whatever Else I'd like to add.

## To get started
* `yarn install`
* `yarn start`
